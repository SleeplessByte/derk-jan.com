Recently [I saw][source-reddit] a very intriguing concept of a Clock made of Clocks which made me think of a [real life object by Humans Since 1982][source-physical].
[The Codepen][source-codepen] shows a clock displaying the current (local) time, and each digit is composed of smaller clocks.

<Component
  pen:title="Clock made of clocks"
  pen:author="EntropyReversed"
  pen:hash="QwybYEJ"
  pen:height={300}
  pen:tab="result"
/>

This inspired my to challenge myself (and you!) to recreate the result (with some choices of my own) **without looking at the implementation**.

## Requirements

Having a look at the result I establish what I want my ClocksClock to be able to do:

- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only;
- Have the full current time (`HH:MM:SS`) represented;
- Each digit is represented by tiny clocks in at 4x6 configuration;
- It animates the digits by animating the tiny clocks;
- All animations are clockwise;
- The initial clock face is randomized;
- When a tiny clock does not participate in the digit, both hands point to the bottom left.

## Challenge

If you like to try this yourself, you should stop here and start working on your own implementation.
If you want to see my implementation and thought process, [read the article](./recreating-clock-of-clocks) for a detailed breakdown.

Once you have finished your implementation, host it online and [share it (including the source) with all of us](https://gist.github.com/SleeplessByte/a2af7b694ae6707494513cced53a10d2).
