Recently [I saw][source-reddit] a very intriguing concept of a Clock made of Clocks which made me think of a [real life object by Humans Since 1982][source-physical].
[The Codepen][source-codepen] shows a clock displaying the current (local) time, and each digit is composed of smaller clocks.

<Component
  pen:title="Clock made of clocks"
  pen:author="EntropyReversed"
  pen:hash="QwybYEJ"
  pen:height={300}
  pen:tab="result"
/>

In this article I recreate the result (with some choices of my own) without looking at the implementation.

## Requirements

Having a look at the result I establish what I want my ClocksClock to be able to do:

- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only;
- Have the full current time (`HH:MM:SS`) represented;
- Each digit is represented by tiny clocks in at 4x6 configuration;
- It animates the digits by animating the tiny clocks;
- All animations are clockwise;
- The initial clock face is randomized;
- When a tiny clock does not participate in the digit, both hands point to the bottom left.

## Challenge

If you like to try this yourself, you should stop here and start working on your own implementation.
If you want to see my implementation and thought process, [keep reading](#digit-layout).

## Digit layout

I think it makes most sense by starting with the grid layout for a single digit.
There are many ways to accomplish this, such as creating each element in JavaScript, or copying a single node many times, but I think I'll go with an actual grid of elements first.
If that works, I'll extract it to a [`<template>` element][mdn-template] and go from there.

```html
<div class="digit">
  <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div>
  <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div>
  <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div>
  <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div>
  <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div>
  <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div>
</div>
```

Let's start with ensuring this looks like a 4x6 grid.
Because of the [`auto-flow`][mdn-grid-auto-flow] algorithm, there are again many ways to define this, but when the exact number of elements, rows, and columns are known, I'll often make it explicit.

```css
.digit {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(6, 1fr);

  gap: 0.5rem;

  & > * {
    outline: 1px solid light-dark(var(--color-pink-600), var(--color-orange-400));
    aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  }
}
```

The repeating pattern is set-up to have each grid cell use the same amount of space (same fractional ratio).
The individual cells (tiny clocks) are set-up to be square.

<PreviewDigitLayout />

## Tiny clock layout

The layout of the tiny clock is the clock face (and perhaps background and frame) with two hands.
The hands are at most half the width of the face, and need to be placed with the "origin" (attachment point) in the center of the clock face.
I can use the pseudo `::before` and `::after` elements to have CSS take care of this.
For the rotation, a CSS variable can be used, which the `::before` and `::after` elements redirect to a different variable, so that it can be set on the tiny clock.

```css
.digit > * {
  position: relative;

  &::before, &::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    background: light-dark(var(--color-pink-600), var(--color-orange-400));
    width: 50%;
    height: 0.5rem;

    left: 50%;
    top: 50%;
    transform-origin: left center;
    transform: translate(0, -50%) rotate(var(--angle, 135deg));
  }

  &::before {
    --angle: var(--angle-hour, -135deg);
  }

  &::after {
    --angle: var(--angle-minute);
  }
}
```

Here one of the clocks has `--angle-minute` and `--angle-hour` set in the HTML:

```html
<div style="--angle-hour: 145deg; --angle-minute: 22deg"></div>
```

<PreviewTinyClockLayout />

The variables can now be used to change the hands of the clock.

<PreviewTinyClockCssVariable />

## Building a digit

I now have the building blocks to create the various digits 0 through 9.
It may seem, with 360 degrees of variation per hand, that there are a lot of different angle combinations, but because of the grid size, each digit only uses 2 variations of clock faces when active and 1 when inactive:

<PreviewTinyClockVariations />

These two active variations are rotated by 180 or 90 degrees respectively.
The digit 0, for example, uses all tiny clocks and all variants:

<PreviewTinyClockDigitZero />

Instead of keeping track of angle pairs, [box drawing unicode][wiki-box-drawing-unicode] can be used to reference the different digits.
It also helps me track each digit visually.
I may change this down the line when animating, but for now, let's encode each digit using these unicode characters.

```css
.digit > * {
  &.─ {
    --angle-hour: 0deg;
    --angle-minute: 180deg;
  }

  &.│ {
    --angle-hour: 90deg;
    --angle-minute: 270deg;
  }

  &.┌ {
    --angle-hour: 0deg;
    --angle-minute: 90deg;
  }

  &.┐ {
    --angle-hour: 180deg;
    --angle-minute: 90deg;
  }

  &.┘ {
    --angle-hour: 180deg;
    --angle-minute: 270deg;
  }

  &.└ {
    --angle-hour: 0deg;
    --angle-minute: 270deg;
  }
}
```

<div class="[&_code]:tracking-widest">
```text
┌──┐  ┌─┐.  ┌──┐  ┌──┐  ┌┐┌┐  ┌──┐  ┌──┐  ┌──┐  ┌──┐  ┌──┐

└──┘  └──┘  └──┘  └──┘  ..└┘  └──┘  └──┘  ..└┘  └──┘  └──┘
```
</div>

## From unicode characters to digits

There are multiple routes I could take now to decode that unicode text to something I can use:

- Define each digit in CSS and use classes to transition between them. This could use `:nth-child`;
- Define each digit as an array of unicode characters in JavaScript;
- Define each digit as an array of angles in JavaScript;
- Something else.

I actually like the way the digits look in textual form, so I decided to parse the content back to individual digits,
and then assign classes to individual DOM elements, or perhaps define the angle-mapping in JavaScript.
We'll see.

```typescript
const ENCODED_DIGITS = `
┌──┐  ┌─┐.  ┌──┐  ┌──┐  ┌┐┌┐  ┌──┐  ┌──┐  ┌──┐  ┌──┐  ┌──┐
│┌┐│  └┐│.  └─┐│  └─┐│  ││││  │┌─┘  │┌─┘  └─┐│  │┌┐│  │┌┐│
││││  .││.  ┌─┘│  .┌┘│  │└┘│  │└─┐  │└─┐  ..││  │└┘│  │└┘│
││││  .││.  │┌─┘  .└┐│  └─┐│  └─┐│  │┌┐│  ..││  │┌┐│  └─┐│
│└┘│  ┌┘└┐  │└─┐  ┌─┘│  ..││  ┌─┘│  │└┘│  ..││  │└┘│  ┌─┘│
└──┘  └──┘  └──┘  └──┘  ..└┘  └──┘  └──┘  ..└┘  └──┘  └──┘
`.trim()
.replace(/[\r\n]/g, '')

const DECODED = Array.from(new Array(10), (_, digit) => {
  const faces = []

  const digitWidth = 4;
  const digitHeight = 6;
  const digitGap = 2;

  const rowLength = digitWidth * 10 + digitGap * 9;
  const x = digit * (digitWidth + digitGap);

  for (let y = 0; y < digitHeight; y++) {
    const start = rowLength * y + digit
    const end = start + digitWidth;

    faces.push(...ENCODED_DIGITS.substring(start, end))
  }

  return faces
});
```

Now I can iterate through the digits by grabbing an array and overwriting the class list.

<PreviewTinyClockDigits />

## Animating a digit

As the CSS properties are affecting the transform, putting a transition on it is probably enough to animate a clock face.

```css
.digit > * {
  &::before, &::after {
    transition: transform var(--duration, 0.5s) ease-in-out;
  }
}
```

This results in a smoother transition.

<PreviewTinyClockTransition />

The requirement is that each face only moves clockwise, so this doesn't quite work, or at least: it's not enough.

In order to make the transition work only clockwise, I could use [the FLIP technique][web-flip] to decrease the rotation by a full circle (`360deg`), and then re-apply the correct class.
It's a really good technique for performant animations, but I think there is a way that's barely any work.
I could instead steadily increase the rotation.
The easiest way to accomplish this is to take the current rotation (currently set by CSS), increase it to `360deg` and then add the expected rotation.
But using `calc()` and a second variable that is the number of times the shape has changed makes it possible to not do any calculation in JavaScript!

```css {3}
.digit > * {
  &::before, &::after {
    transform: translate(0, -50%) rotate(calc(360deg * var(--iterations, 0) + var(--angle, 135deg)));
  }
}
```

Each time the class changes, increase `--iterations` by 1 and we're done!

<PreviewTinyClockWiseTransition />

Ugh. Okay it satisfies the requirement, but because the hour and angle hand are animated separately based on the angles in the CSS, and those do not guarantee that the hour and minute hand make the smallest increase, this actually feels much busier than the previous implementation.

I suppose the easiest way to solve this is to pull a bit of the logic into JavaScript:

1. For each shape, pull the desired angles;
2. Get the current angles;
3. Find the minimum distance between both hands and the new angles;
   a. If this is 0, then nothing has changed and no animation is needed;
   b. If the new angle is smaller than the old angle, then animating to it by *adding* a circle will make it animate clockwise;
   c. If the new angle is larger than the old angle, then animating to it can be accomplished without adding a full circle;
4. Set the new angles;

```javascript

```
