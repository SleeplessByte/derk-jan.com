My personal blog. Based on [overreacted.io](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io/) which was forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). Syntax theme based on the small tweaks by Dan Ambramov on top of [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/).

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn start`, then open https://localhost:8000.
